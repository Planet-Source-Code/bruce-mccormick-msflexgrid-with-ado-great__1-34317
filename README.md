## MSFlexGrid With ADO \- GREAT


</div>

### Description

I need your opinion/suggestions. I'm a newbie to VB. This is a complete grid program that updates the DB row behind the grid row every time you change rows to minimize possible data loss. Uses excellent ADO procs and has a great error handling routine. Also has alternating color lines and row and col totals. Uses cbo and a calendar popup as well as text box overlay on the grid. There is a more complete explanation (along with a few of my questions) in the .txt file that opens with the project.
